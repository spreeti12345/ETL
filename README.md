# ETL

## Overview of this project
We were expected to get data from open sources like Kaggle, Extract data in CSV / JSON format. We were taught to transform data with regex and other codes . Finally we used sql and Postgres to load the information into csv files. </br>

I believe this is the most important part of SQL. I particularly found this Module difficult requiring more than alloted time.</br> 

Files in this Repo-
3 IPYNB files with the ETL process</br>
PNG file with movies and ratings query</br>
Archive with resources- 2 csv and 1 json file</br>
